#      Pressing a key turns the display backlight back on.
#  - handle_bluetooth_toggle
#      Toggles internal bluetooth adapter on/off.

#      Toggles internal camera on/off.

#      Toggles between panel and VGA (as configured above).

#      Toggles internal GSM modem (HUAWEI) on/off.

#      Instead of having eeepc-acpi-scripts handle the key, pass it on as
#      an ordinary input event, allowing your window manager or desktop
#      environment handle it (either via a default key binding or else
#      a custom binding configured by you).
#      * This is generally only needed in case the kernel driver does not
#        generate any input event (testable with evtest using "EeePC extra
#        buttons" input# reported in dmesg).  A couple of keys known to not
#        generate any input events in Debian kernel version 2.6.32-23 are
